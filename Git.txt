Git: --> VCS

Version Control System:
Records the change to a file or set of files
Types: Local, Centrealized(Central copy of out project) and Distributed

With the help of this we can manage different version of source code.
Main responsibilties -> to keep all the team members are on the same page, mainly for collaboration.

Repository acts like a server.
It ll protect and track of all modification in the source code.

Commit -- saving the changes and stored in the git directory
Distributed --> own server for every single developer, they ll have copy of the entire history of code.
Getting new changes from the repo --> pulling
merging the changes to the repo --> pushing



GIT:
Every project contains this three sections:
Working directory --> its on disk, checkout the project
staging area --> all the files which are ready for commit
Git directory --> repo
